# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

In this challenge, I used data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models were compared.

An initial prediction that the Logistic Regression would be the most accurate turned out to be wrong. Anaysis shows that the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models had a calculated accuracy of 0.9021 and 0.9160, respectitvely. This the Random Forest model had a slight edge compared to the Logistic Regression model.
